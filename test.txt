**Major**: University Studies -- Economics & Data Science

**Programming Experience**: I have some coding experience. I took an elements of computing class in my previous university and used markdown to create a website, as well as used python to create and run basic data scraping and cleaning projects. However, I worked on replit, so using the local terminal is very new to me.

**Favourite Hobby**: reading and watching movies
